# 🎬 MoviesLix - Backend

> A learning-based fork of [03sid-sharma/movieslix-Backend](https://github.com/03sid-sharma/movieslix-Backend)

This is the backend for the MoviesLix MERN project. I forked and used it to gain practical experience in building and working with Node.js/Express APIs, JWT authentication, and MongoDB integration.

## 🚀 Tech Stack (Backend)

- **Node.js + Express**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **REST APIs** for users and movies
- **Role-based Access & Middleware**
- **Error handling & validation**

---

## 🧠 What I Explored & Learned

- How user authentication works using JWTs.
- How protected routes and middleware are structured in Express.
- Connecting backend to a frontend React app.
- Working with MongoDB schemas and API structure.
- Debugging backend issues and understanding logs and responses.

## 📌 My Role

> This backend was created by [Sid Sharma](https://github.com/03sid-sharma). I used it to **study real-world backend structure** and test API functionality.

Here’s what I actually did:

- Ran and tested the backend using Postman and frontend integration.
- Studied the logic for login, token validation, and data fetching.
- Connected it with the frontend to run the full stack locally.
- Debugged some routes and added test cases for learning purposes.

## 🙏 Credits

Massive credit to [Sid Sharma](https://github.com/03sid-sharma) for building this project and sharing it openly. This repo is part of my self-learning journey into full-stack development.

This backend helped me apply what I was learning in tutorials in a practical, working environment.
